# SPM - Side Project Manager

SPM is a Python CLI for managing your side projects! The project uses [PyInquirer](https://github.com/CITGuru/PyInquirer). 
SPM works on both MacOS terminal and Windows command prompt (but is prettier on Mac).

## Documentation

### Usage
First, ensure that you have all the dependencies denoted in `requirements.txt`. Download the project and open the terminal/command line in the project folder. 

Note: on Windows, set the font of the command prompt window to `Lucida Console` font, due to issues with displaying UTF-8 symbols with PyInquirer.

To run the CLI:
```bash
$ python cli.py
```
and embrace your new productivity!
